## Git Structure

We have decided to use `Feature branching` for our git workflow.

## Git branches

There are a total of 4 branches. The different brances are:

1. main
2. feature/buzzer
3. feature/powerChange
4. feature/addTime


## Jenkins jobs

There are a total of 4 jobs - one for each branch. The different jobs are:

1. team04E22-microwave-main
2. team04E22-microwave-feature-buzzer
3. team04E22-microwave-feature-powerChange
4. team04E22-microwave-feature-addTime
