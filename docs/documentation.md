### Git Structure

We have decided to use `Feature branching` for our git workflow.

### Git branches

There are a total of 4 branches. The different brances are:

1. main
2. feature/buzzer
3. feature/powerChange
4. feature/timeChange


## Jenkins jobs

There are a total of 4 jobs - one for each branch. Links to the different jobs:

1. [team04E22-microwave-main](http://ci3.ase.au.dk:8080/job/team04E22-microwave-main/)
2. [team04E22-microwave-feature-buzzer](http://ci3.ase.au.dk:8080/job/team04E22-microwave-feature-buzzer/)
3. [team04E22-microwave-feature-powerChange](http://ci3.ase.au.dk:8080/job/team04E22-microwave-feature-powerCharge/)
4. [team04E22-microwave-feature-timeChange](http://ci3.ase.au.dk:8080/job/team04E22-microwave-feature-timeChange/)

## Class diagram

It was decided to use the existing class diagram as a base and only add any changes we made to it.

### Time change

## Updated state machine diagram

It was decided to copy the diagram from the handout and extend it with the new features. Additions are colored blue.

## Description of changes and additions

<!--Ony what, not why.
Explain and reference to diagrams where relevant-->

### Buzzer

There has been implemented a buzzer class that has the responsibility of making a 3 burst sound whenever Cooking is done.
This is obtained by making an interface and a class that implements this interface which has 1 function "CookingIsEndedSound()".
CookingController.cs and UserInterface.cs have been altered so as it also takes a buzzer object in its constructor parameter.
The function CookingIsEndedSound() is then inserted in CookController.OnTimerExpired(), CookController.Stop() and UserInterface.CookingIsDone().

In the tests the test.integration project was unloaded so to avoid testings conflicts.
The BuzzerTest.cs tests the simple functionality of the buzzer class. It creates a Trace object which can catch console outputs when running the tests. This output is then asserted with the expected string value "Ding, Ding, Ding! Cooking Done\a".

There has also been written a functional test in the CookingControllerTest.cs. Cooking_stopsound_CookingDone() tests if the CookingIsEndedSound() through the uut (CookController.StartCooking() function). 

### Power change

### Time change

The only things added to the code are 
- `UserInterface` has a reference to the `Timer` to make it possible to add time while cooking.
- In the `UserInterface` state machine (switch case), the logic for adding time while in state `cooking` was addded. 
- The `Timer` classes property TimeRemaining was changed to have a public setter instead of the private in the original.
